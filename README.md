Program to learn vocabulary

With little help from Angela Yu - hints (100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023 on Udemy)
I made a program to learn vocabulary of any language - with little effort is possible to change language vocabulary.

Program will launch in its own separate window (programed with Tkinter). Thanks to Pandas module the program will remember 
which vocabulary user already knows and which not - at every card user will choose between check-mark or X-mark to determinate 
if he knows the word.
